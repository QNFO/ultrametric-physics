# CHANGELOG: Cross-Ratio Convergence

---

## 2026-05-12 — Reader Test Complete: Critical Finding

**What Changed:** Completed blind reader testing of convergence synthesis (0.1.md). Three-lens evaluation (logical coherence 4/10, mathematical soundness 5/10, reader experience 5/10). Critical finding: 3 of 4 source projects (Kapustin-Witten, Ultrametric Synthesis, Undecidability) contain ZERO occurrences of "cross-ratio" — the convergence was retroactively imposed by the capstone, not independently discovered. Recommendations for revision documented.

**Files Changed:** 0.27.md (new), SPRINT.md (edit)

**Git:** feature/consolidate-cross-ratio-convergence, commit `98923cd`

---

## 2026-05-12 — Repo Isolation Fix

**What Changed:** Initialized independent `.git/` inside Cross-Ratio Convergence/. Project now has its own git repo (root = project directory), not shared with sibling projects. Parent repo untracked all 34 Cross-Ratio files. Inner `.git/` confirmed as repo root.

**Files Changed:** `.git/` (new, inside project), parent repo (34 files `git rm --cached`)

**Git:** feat/consolidate-cross-ratio-convergence (child: `f916c1b`), parent: `7674c86`

---

## 2026-05-12 — Directory Flattened

**What Changed:** Removed subdirectories from Cross-Ratio Convergence. All 25 source files renamed with sequential versioned filenames (0.2–0.26). Created SOURCES.md provenance mapping. Updated PROJECT STATE.md and SPRINT.md to reflect flat structure.

**Files Changed:** 25 files renamed/moved, SOURCES.md (new), PROJECT STATE.md (edit), SPRINT.md (edit)

**Git:** feature/consolidate-cross-ratio-convergence

---

## 2026-05-12 — Project Consolidation

**What Changed:** Consolidated four independent projects (Braids as Correlations, Kapustin-Witten Duality, Ultrametric Synthesis, Undecidability) into a single unified project directory. Old project directories deleted. Source content preserved in subdirectories. Unified 7-file documentation created. Convergence synthesis written as 0.1.md.

**Files Changed:** 
- Created: Cross-Ratio Convergence/ (25 source files + 7 doc files + 0.1.md)
- Deleted: Braids as Correlations/, Kapustin-Witten Duality/, Ultrametric Synthesis/, Undecidability/

**Git:** feature/consolidate-cross-ratio-convergence

---

## 2026-05-12 (pre-consolidation) — Word Cross-Ratio Excised

**What Changed:** Removed Word Cross-Ratio from convergence argument. Zipfian "cross-ratio" is a statistical ratio, not the projective 4-point invariant.

**Git:** feature/clean-slate

---

## 2026-05-12 (pre-consolidation) — Convergence Synthesis Drafted

**What Changed:** Initial convergence synthesis woven from all 4 projects.

**Git:** feature/clean-slate

---

## 2026-05-11 and earlier — Individual Projects Developed

**What Changed:** Four projects independently developed:
- Braids as Correlations: alpha as cross-ratio, process ontology, 5 content files
- Kapustin-Witten Duality: N=4 SYM to geometric Langlands, 7 companion notes
- Ultrametric Synthesis: Archimedean critique, 1 analysis + source PDFs
- Undecidability: Projection artifacts, 3 essays
